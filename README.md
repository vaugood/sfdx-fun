# Playing with API Interviews

This project explores the various ways a developer can invoke a screen flow.

## Challenge

The primary focus of this project is to see if it is possible to:
1) Invoke a screen flow from a non-lightning object (Task, for instance) from a button on the record page.
2) Pass the sObject Id to the flow via the button.
